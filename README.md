# NFT Marketplace

This repository contains the smart contract code and documentation for an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace called "NFT Marketplace." The marketplace is implemented as a Solidity smart contract and follows the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.

## Overview

The NFT Marketplace allows users to mint new NFTs and trade existing NFTs in a decentralized manner. Each NFT is unique and represented as a token on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can mint new NFTs by paying a specified price and can buy existing NFTs from other users at their listed prices. The marketplace also includes royalty fees for the artist on each transaction.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the NFT Marketplace smart contract, you need the following prerequisites:

1. Ethereum Wallet: You need an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the smart contract. Ensure that you have some Ether (ETH) in your wallet for gas fees and transactions.

2. Truffle: Truffle is used for contract compilation, deployment, and testing. Install Truffle globally with `npm install -g truffle`.

3. Ganache: Ganache provides a local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing. Install Ganache from [https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

4. Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

5. Dependencies: Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Deployment

1. Open Ganache and create a new workspace. Select the "Quickstart" option, and Ganache will create a local blockchain with pre-funded accounts.

2. In the project root directory, run `truffle compile` to compile the smart contracts.

3. Run `truffle migrate` to deploy the smart contract to the local Ganache blockchain.

4. The contract is now deployed, and you will get the contract address. Use this address in your decentralized application (DApp) to interact with the NFT Marketplace.

## Usage

The NFT Marketplace smart contract provides the following functions:

- `payToMint`: Allows users to mint a new NFT by paying the specified cost.
- `payToBuy`: Allows users to buy an existing NFT by paying the specified price.
- `changePrice`: Allows NFT owners to change the price of their NFT.
- `getAllNFTs`: Returns an array of all minted NFTs.
- `getNFT`: Returns information about a specific NFT.
- `getAllTransactions`: Returns an array of all transactions.

Interact with these functions using Web3 or other Ethereum-compatible libraries in your DApp.
